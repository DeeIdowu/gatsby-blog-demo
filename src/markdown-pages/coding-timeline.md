## Initial Start

Age 11 in Computer class, learning the intricacies of the internet via use of FreeWebs and gaming via MiniClips, MapleStory and RuneScape

## Present

Embarked on the journey again by enrolling in Coding Bootcamp by Trilogy hosted by University of Toronto May 2018. The Boot Camp enabled me the hone the skills required in todays job market: MySQL, MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS. I've also sharpened in my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the course of the past year.
